# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: October 2, 2025_

Thank you for using our platform. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of student records in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and applicable state and federal regulations. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the rights users have over their information.

---

## Overview

This website is a secure digital note-taking tool designed for use by licensed school counselors and education staff. It allows counselors to track notes, student referrals, and academic or behavioral observations ‚Äî with strict controls to ensure privacy and regulatory compliance.

---

## Compliance

### FERPA

We adhere to the U.S. **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**. All student records created, stored, or shared within this platform are treated as **education records** under FERPA when applicable.

We do not sell, lease, or disclose student information to third parties, except as permitted under FERPA or with proper consent.

### HIPAA

HIPAA does **not** apply to records protected by FERPA. Therefore, student counseling notes on this platform are governed by **FERPA**, not HIPAA. This applies to nearly all K‚Äì12 school counselor usage.

---

## Information We Collect

We may collect and store the following data:

### User Data (Counselors, Admins)

- Name and email
- Password (securely hashed)
- School affiliation (`schoolCode`)
- Role (`counselor`, `admin`)
- Verification status

### Session Data

- Authentication tokens
- IP address (for logging purposes)
- Session creation and expiration times

### Student Records

- Student ID, name, grade level
- Referral info
- Counselor notes and session logs
- ‚ÄúShared with‚Äù metadata (i.e., users with access)
- Timestamps for record creation

---

## Purpose of Data Collection

All data is collected strictly for educational purposes:

- To allow counselors to record, access, and manage session notes
- To facilitate collaboration between authorized staff at the same school
- To ensure compliance with FERPA for access logging and data control

---

## üë• Access Controls

We implement strict **role-based access control (RBAC)**:

- **Counselors** can only access notes they‚Äôve created or those shared with them.
- **Admins** may view all notes within their school code group.
- Cross-school access is **strictly prohibited** unless authorized in writing.

---

## Data Logging & Audit Trails

We maintain backend logs of all access to student records:

- Who viewed or edited a note
- When access occurred
- What action was taken

This helps fulfill FERPA's accountability requirements and aids in auditing improper access.

---

## Data Retention & Deletion

Counselor notes and student records are retained for educational use unless:

- The record is archived or deleted by the user or admin
- A school or parent/legal guardian requests removal (if allowed under FERPA)
- The note has exceeded the defined school-specific retention policy

We support **soft deletion**, and permanent deletion can be requested by administrators.

---

## Your Rights

Counselors and school-authorized personnel have the right to:

- Access and edit their user data
- Delete their own notes (if not shared)
- View audit logs related to their account activity

Parents or eligible students (18+) have rights under FERPA to:

- Request access to records maintained about them
- Request correction of inaccurate or misleading data

These rights must be exercised through the school, not directly through this platform.

---

## Third-Party Services

We may use third-party cloud services (e.g., AWS, email services) for secure infrastructure and communications. These providers do **not** access student records and must meet strict compliance standards.

---

## Security Measures

We implement industry best practices:

- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Secure password hashing
- Email verification
- Session-based JWT authentication
- Access control by school and role
- Audit logs of access activity

No user credentials or student records are stored in plain text.

---

## Breach Notification Policy

In the event of a data breach affecting student records:

- We will notify affected institutions as soon as possible, within the timeline required by applicable law.
- We will work closely with school administrators and IT teams to assess impact and remediation steps.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically to reflect platform improvements or legal changes. We'll notify users through the app or email when significant updates occur.

---
